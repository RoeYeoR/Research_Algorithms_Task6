"""
Test module for the Santa Claus Problem algorithm implementation in the restricted assignment case.

In the restricted assignment case, each present j has a fixed value pj for all kids
who can receive it, and 0 for kids who cannot receive it.

Tests cover both simple and complex cases, including:
1. Basic allocation with restricted assignment valuations
2. Complex restricted assignment cases
3. Edge cases with different capacities

The Santa Claus Problem involves distributing presents among kids to maximize
the happiness of the least happy kid.
